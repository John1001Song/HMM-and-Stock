### Motivation

Instead of trying traditional approach (Markowitz Mean-Variance Model) to do investment, we want to use Hidden Markov Model to predict stock price in a short time period. 

This project is based on the article: "An Analysis and Implementation of the Hidden Markov Model to Technology Stock Prediction".
